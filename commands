The application is meant to be run on an embedded device however it
could be run over the network as long as the remote server is trusted.
SSH would be used to connect to it.

token {

bool immutable:
    Can't be deleted or modified in any way. This flag can't be unset
    (without mounting the SD card in a new device and modifying the
    database).

blob key:
    The private key to the token.
    This must *never* be exposed over the command line interface.

int digits:
    Number of digits for token. Up to 9 is allowed.

str type:
    Token type. Either TOTP,HOTP, all other values are errors.

str name:
    An identifier for the token.
    This uniquely identifies the token.

    Example names would be "desktop_ssh" or "github".
    This can't have any spaces in it (due to the parser).

str description:
    This allows you to give more information about a token.
    This is a single line of any data.

}

token
    add <token-name> --type hotp|totp --digits 1-9 --key <key> 
    del <token-name>
        You'll be asked to confirm the token deletion by entering the
        name again.
    mod <token-name> set immutable|description
        If you try to set immutable, it will prompt like
        Are you *sure* you want to set this token immutable?
        This will prevent any modification or deletion, even of the
        description.
        Type "YES." to confirm.

        If you set the description, the prompt will be
            description>
        and you'll be able to set a line of text there.
    mod <token-name> get immutable|digits|type|description
        The key is not readable by design, and the name is already
        given.
